## Installing and Running the Application

First, you will need NodeJS and npm, which you can install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

We then will need to install expo-cli which is used for building and running ```npm install -g expo-cli```

Once expo-cli is installed you can navigate to "Project" in your terminal and enter ```npm run web```.
This will open up a webpage with a QR code you can scan to run the application. For this to work you must install the "Expo Go"
iOS or Android app. 

If you do not want to install Expo Go, you can build and test on an emulator or your phone over usb with either of these commands:

```
npm run android
npm run ios
```
